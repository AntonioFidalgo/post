<div id="motivation" class="section level1">
<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>I have been strongly promoting the use of .Rmd files for research—e.g., <a href="https://antoniofidalgo.page/discoveR/why.html" target="_blank">here</a>. This type of file combines text editing—in Markdown language—and data analysis—in R language—in one single document, allowing for reproducible research as well as dynamic documents.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Overall, the workflow associated with these files sets a high epistemological standard of good practices in science.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>It occurred to me that the layout of the Master’s dissertation and its conformity with the School’s requirements may prevent students from adopting that standard. So I decided to help lift that obstacle by offering a .Rmd template for dissertations at CLSBE.</p>
<p>As of now, I came up with a beta v.0.1—first draft. I will first gauge if it proves useful and worth maintaining. So I’m putting it out as a work in progress along with a call for comments, suggestions, etc.</p>
<p>Actually, there are two fronts in this project—for both the <strong>feedback is much welcome</strong>: a template and a manual.</p>
</div>
<div id="download-the-template" class="section level1">
<h1>Download the Template</h1>
<p>The template is a R project, i.e., a bundle of files containing the main .Rmd file. You can download the latest version <a href="clsbe-thesis.zip">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="check-out-the-manual" class="section level1">
<h1>Check out the Manual</h1>
<p>An online manual with all sorts of instructions for using the template is also available. Read it <a href="https://antoniofidalgo.page/template/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>The manual requires the same credentials as for this blog post.</p>
</div>
<div id="try-knit" class="section level1">
<h1>Try Knit</h1>
<p>The file <code>template.Rmd</code> should be ready to <code>Knit</code> out of the box, albeit slowly at the first attempt.</p>
<p>Please let me know of your experience.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>I’m focusing here on .Rmd because R is our software of choice. But I should mention that there is a restricted list of alternative files that share these features.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>The Master’s dissertation is an exercise in scientific investigation. As such, it should abide by the rules of scientific investigation. Logically, I see no reason for students to not use a .Rmd file for their thesis. Incidentally, recalling the scientific nature of the exercise is sufficient to discard the fallacious argument of the “industry-compatibility”—use what is used in the industry. The firm may rationally reject the .Rmd workflow based on a cost-benefit analysis. But this should have no bearing on the choices made at University where other criteria are used.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
