# Posts in routeR

In this repo, you can find the original Rmd files of the routeR blog.  

I do my best to make them self-contained so that they easily knit in your machine. If you hit an error, please let me know.

The auxiliary files (figures, data, etc) are in this platform. Download them to avoid an  error when knitting.
